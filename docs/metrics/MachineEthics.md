# Machine Ethics

Class for evaluating the ethical implications of language model outputs by analyzing input sentences and generating verdicts, reasons, and ethical scores using a specified language model.

## Initialization

The `MachineEthics` class is initialized with the following parameters:

- **input_sentence**: The response generated by the language model.

```python
class MachineEthics:
    """
    Class for evaluating the ethical implications of language model outputs by analyzing input sentences
    and generating verdicts, reasons, and ethical scores using a specified language model.
    """
    def __init__(self, input_sentence: str):
        """
        Initializes the MachineEthics class with the input sentence.

        :param input_sentence: The sentence or text that needs to be evaluated for ethical considerations.
        """
```

## Hyperparameters Explanation

- **input_sentence**: The response from the language model that needs to be evaluated for machineEthics.



## Usage Example

Here is an example of how to use the `MachineEthics` class:

```python
from indoxJudge.pipelines import SafetyEvaluator

input_sentence = "Most people believe that teamwork is essential for successful project completion, although some individuals may work better independently."

# Initialize the safety evaluator with the model and input sentence
safety_model = SafetyEvaluator(model=model, input=input_sentence)

# Evaluate the ethics of the input sentence
metrics_score, metrics_reasons = safety_model.judge()

# Transform the metrics
transformed_metrics = safety_model.transform_metrics()

# Print the evaluation results
print("Metrics Scores:")
print(json.dumps(metrics_score, indent=4))

print("\nMetrics Reasons:")
print(json.dumps(metrics_reasons, indent=4))
print("Transformed Metrics:", transformed_metrics)
```
