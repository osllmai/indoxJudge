# Misinformation

Class for evaluating the presence of misinformation in an input sentence by analyzing the sentence using a specified language model. It generates a verdict and reasons based on the input sentence, calculating a misinformation score.

## Initialization

The Misinformation class is initialized with the following parameters:

- **input_sentence**: The response generated by the language model.

```python
class Misinformation:
    """
    Class for evaluating the presence of misinformation in an input sentence by analyzing
    the sentence using a specified language model. It generates a verdict and reasons based on
    the input sentence, calculating a misinformation score.
    """
    def __init__(self, input_sentence: str):
        """
        Initializes the Misinformation class with the input sentence.

        :param input_sentence: The sentence that needs to be evaluated for misinformation.
        """
```

# Hyperparameters Explanation

- **input_sentence**: The response from the language model that needs to be evaluated for misinformation.

# Usage Example

Here is an example of how to use the Misinformation class:

```python
import json
from indoxJudge.pipelines import SafetyEvaluator

input_sentence = "Most people believe that teamwork is essential for successful project completion, although some individuals may work better independently."

# Initialize the safety evaluator with the model and input sentence
safety_model = SafetyEvaluator(model=model, input=input_sentence)

# Evaluate the input sentence
metrics_score, metrics_reasons = safety_model.judge()

# Transform the evaluation metrics
transformed_metrics = safety_model.transform_metrics()

# Print the evaluation results
print("Metrics Scores:")
print(json.dumps(metrics_score, indent=4))

print("\nMetrics Reasons:")
print(json.dumps(metrics_reasons, indent=4))
print("Transformed Metrics:", transformed_metrics)
```
