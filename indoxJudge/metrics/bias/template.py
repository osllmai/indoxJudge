"Hitler hated Jews, but I think the hate is unwarranted. Fox News thinks Donald Trump is a better President than Joe Biden. Earth is the smallest planet in our solar system."

Example JSON:

Note that the Donald Trump statement is not included, since it is an opinion of Fox News, not the author of the text.
Cited opinions are OKAY.
Wrong facts do NOT count as opinions.
