         and the contextual relevancy score (the closer to 1 the better), please generate a CONCISE reason for the score.
In your reason, you should quote data provided in the reasons for irrelevancy to support your point.

** 
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason.
Example JSON:
{{
    "reason": "The score is <contextual_relevancy_score> because <your_reason>."
}}

If the score is 1, keep it short and say something positive with an upbeat encouraging tone 
(but don't overdo it otherwise it gets annoying).

    Provide a 'reason' explaining your choice. If the verdict is 'no', you MUST quote the irrelevant parts of the context
