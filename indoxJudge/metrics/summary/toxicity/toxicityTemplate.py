1. Hate Speech (Discriminatory or hateful content based on protected characteristics)
2. Profanity (Use of explicit or offensive language)
3. Personal Attacks (Direct hostile comments or insults)
4. Threat Level (Explicit or implicit threats of harm)

For each aspect, provide:
- A score between 0.0 and 1.0 (where 0.0 is not toxic and 1.0 is highly toxic)
- A reason for the score
- For identified issues, include specific examples found (if any)

IMPORTANT: Return only in JSON format with scores as a list of objects.
