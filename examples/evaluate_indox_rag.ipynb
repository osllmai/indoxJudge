Oh dear! I shall be late!â\\x80\\x9d (when she thought it over afterwards,\\r\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\r\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\r\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\r\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\r\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\r\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\r\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\r\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\r\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\r\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\r\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\r\\ndeep well.',\n",

She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\r\\npassed; it was labelled â\\x80\\x9cORANGE MARMALADEâ\\x80\\x9d, but to her great\\r\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\r\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\r\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d thought Alice to herself, â\\x80\\x9cafter such a fall as this, I shall\\r\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs!

    "This section explains the additional hyperparameters available when configuring the **QuestionAnswer** retriever in **Indox**. The retriever uses a vector database and language model to fetch relevant content and provide answers to queries. We will cover the following hyperparameters:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **llm**: The language model used to generate answers (e.g., OpenAI GPT models).\n",
    "- **vector_database**: The vector database used for embedding retrieval (e.g., Chroma).\n",
    "- **top_k**: Determines how many of the most relevant documents to retrieve (default is 5).\n",
    "- **document_relevancy_filter**: If set to `True`, only the most relevant documents are retrieved based on relevancy filtering.\n",
    "- **generate_clustered_prompts**: If set to `True`, this enables the retriever to cluster the retrieved documents and generate summaries for each cluster. The summary is added to the retrieval context, helping improve the overall response quality by providing a more structured context.\n"
