    "Passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong password is important to protect your online accounts. When you are selecting a password, keep the following tips in mind:\n",
    "Strong (good) passwords have the following characteristics:\n",
    "Contain both upper and lower-case characters (e.g., a–z, A–Z)\n",
    "Have digits and punctuation characters as well as letters (e.g., 0–9, !@#$%^&*)\n",
    "Fourteen (14) or more alphanumeric characters\n",
    "Not based on personal information, names of family, or important calendar dates\n",
    "Change passwords frequently.\n",
    "Consider using a password manager.\n",
    "Keep your new password private and change it immediately if someone else learns it or you believe it has been compromised in any way.\n",
    "Constructing a passphrase based on a sentence or phrase makes a password easy to remember. Passphrase is a type of string password that uses a short sentence or group of random words.\n",
    "Weak (bad) passwords have the following characteristics:\n",
    "Default password\n",
    "Contain less than eight (8) characters\n",
    "Common, easily guessed phrases (e.g. \"Winter is coming\")\n",
    "A common usage word such as names of family, pets, friends, co-workers, fantasy characters, etc.\n",
    "The words \"Northwestern Mutual\" or any derivation\n",
    "Do not use Social Security numbers, words or numbers associated with easily attainable personal information, like birthdays, anniversaries, license plates, telephone numbers, or addresses.\n",
    "Do not use the same pattern for your passwords, such as smart1, smart2, etc.\n",
    "Any of the above spelled backward\n",
    "Any of the above preceded or followed by a digit (e.g., secret1 or 1secret).\n",
    "Do not use real names or your login name or any variation of it.\n",
    "Do not write down your password or share your password with anyone else.\n",
    "Do not reuse passwords. Make sure you use different and unique passwords for all of your online accounts. Reusing a single password for multiple websites is never a good idea. If a cybercriminal obtains your password, they may try to use it on other websites.\n",
    "Protecting your account: Be prepared to provide your account/policy number when reaching out to us to set up the following safeguards:\n",
    "Life, Disability Income and Annuity: You can request a password to be used to verify your identity when you call the home office.\n",

    "Staying safe online\n",
    "Email Hacking: Email hacking occurs when a cybercriminal illegally gains access to an individual's email account. This allows the hacker to read email messages and view the address book on the email account. Using this information, the cybercriminal (appearing to be the individual), contacts the individual's financial institutions via an email message and tries to obtain funds. Learn about how to protect yourself at Email Hacking Fraud. When email hacking occurs, emails can/will be intercepted and deleted by the hacker, and the rightful sender and receiver will no longer see legitimate email traffic. We recommend that you take the following actions to protect yourself:\n",
    "Never give your email address to anyone or any site that you do not trust.\n",
    "Never send personal or sensitive information in an unsecured email.\n",
    "Phishing: One of the most common ways cybercriminals trick their victims is through phishing. This occurs when a cybercriminal tries to either get the victim to reveal confidential information or installs malicious software (malware) on the victim's computer. A phishing attack can take many forms, although the most common is an email message.\n",
    "Identifying phishing messages: common phishing message characteristics and red flags include:\n",
    "Unsolicited email or attachments: Always regard unsolicited email or attachments as suspicious, even if the message appears to come from a known sender. The \"From\" address in emails can be easily faked. In addition, the sender's email account may have been hacked.\n",
    "Spoofing: Email spoofing refers to email messages that are sent with a forged sender address. The email is sent to look like it is from a known company or people such as your friend, relative, or co-worker, but the email is fake.\n",
    "If you receive an email asking for confidential information and demanding unusual or urgent action, be suspicious. Take action against this and call the sender directly, using contact information on record, to ask if they sent the email.\n",
    "Generic greetings: Phishing messages often contain generic, non-personalized greetings both in the subject line and the message. Some legitimate messages may contain generic greetings, but a generic greeting should raise suspicions. It's important to note, though, that a personalized greeting in and of itself does not guarantee that a message is legitimate.\n",
    "Urgent or threatening language: Many phishing messages contain urgent or threatening language. Phishers often try to manipulate people's emotions. Don't fall for that trick. Take the time to examine unsolicited messages carefully.\n",
    "Awkward grammar or spelling errors: Awkward grammar or spelling errors may be signs of phishing messages. However, don't assume that polished, professional-looking messages are necessarily legitimate.\n",
    "Tricky links: Always be suspicious of links in unsolicited messages. The web address displayed in the message can be easily faked. Hover the mouse pointer over the link on a computer or long-press the link on a mobile device to preview the actual link address.\n",
    "Never send personal or sensitive information in an unsecured (unencrypted) email.\n",
    "Never make a purchase from an unsolicited email. Not only can an email user fall prey to a potentially fraudulent sales scheme, but their email address may be added to email lists sold within the spamming community, further compounding the number of unsolicited emails the user receives.\n",
    "Phishing resources: To learn more about phishing and handling phishing messages, see the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website.\n",
